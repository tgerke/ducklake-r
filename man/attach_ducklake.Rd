This function is a wrapper for the ducklake \href{https://ducklake.select/docs/stable/duckdb/usage/connecting}{ATTACH} command.
It will create a new DuckDB-backed DuckLake if the specified name does not exist, or connect to the existing DuckLake if it does exist.
The connection is stored in the package environment and can be closed with detach_ducklake().
}
