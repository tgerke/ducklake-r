\title{Query a table at a specific timestamp (time travel)}
\usage{
get_ducklake_table_asof(table_name, timestamp, conn = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{table_name}{The name of the table to query}

\item{timestamp}{A POSIXct timestamp or character string in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2024-01-15 10:30:00")}

\item{conn}{Optional DuckDB connection object. If not provided, uses the default ducklake connection.}
}
\value{
A dplyr lazy query object (tbl_lazy) that can be further manipulated with dplyr verbs
}
\description{
Retrieves data from a DuckDB table as it existed at a specific point in time
using DuckDB's snapshot/time-travel functionality.
}
\details{
DuckDB supports time-travel queries using the ASOF syntax, allowing you to query
historical data as it existed at a specific timestamp. This is useful for:
\itemize{
\item Auditing changes over time
\item Recovering accidentally deleted or modified data
\item Comparing data states across different time points
}

Note: This functionality requires that the table has been properly configured with
DuckDB's time-travel features (e.g., Delta Lake tables with snapshot support).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Query data as it existed yesterday
yesterday <- Sys.time() - (24 * 60 * 60)
get_ducklake_table_asof("my_table", yesterday) |>
  filter(category == "A") |>
  collect()

# Query data at a specific timestamp
get_ducklake_table_asof("my_table", "2024-01-15 10:30:00") |>
  summarise(total = sum(amount))
}
}
